# Data

Base 2 representation of a number is called binary.

Why do computers speak in binary?

becuase it's easier for logic gates, it's either on or off not half on or half off.

Words :- Words are groupings of 8-bit bytes architectures define the word width.

Nibble: half of a byte,4 bits.
Byte: 1 byte, 8 bits.
Half word/"word" : 2 bytes, 16 bits
Double word(dword): 4 bytes, 32 bits
Quad word(qword): 8 bytes, 64 bits

A 64 bit machine can reason about 64 bits at a time.

When we give data over the capacity of a storage unit overflow occurs, and when we give data below the capacity(eg below 0) and underflow error occurs.

Negative numbers are expressed in 2's compliment , proposed by jhon von neumann.

In a data representation the right most bit is called the most significant bit as a change in its data can have a huge impact on the number itself, and the leftmost bit is least significant bit which doesn't affect the value of the number  that much.
