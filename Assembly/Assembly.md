# Assembly

The binary and the assembly code is equivalent.

One of the simplest languages ever.

Some operands in assembly are as follows

add
sub
mul
div
mov
com
test

Every architecture have their own assembly instructions.

eg: x86,arm,mips etc

General structure of an assembly instruction are as follows

operation
operation operand
operation operand operand
operation operand operand operand

intel created x86 assembly syntax.

AT&T assembly syntax is horrible.
